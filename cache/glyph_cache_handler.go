// A [GlyphCacheHandler] acts as an intermediator between a glyph cache
// and another object, typically a [Renderer], to give the later a clear
// target interface to conform to while abstracting the details of an
// underlying cache, which might be finickier to deal with directly
// in a performant way.
//
// Glyph cache handlers can't be used concurrently unless the concrete
// implementation explicitly says otherwise.

	// --- configuration notification methods ---
	// Update methods (called only if required so overhead can be low).
	// Passed values must always be non-nil, except for NotifyOtherChange().

	// Notifies that the font in use has changed.
	NotifyFontChange(*sfnt.Font)

	// Notifies that the text size (in pixels) has changed.
	NotifySizeChange(fract.Unit)

	// Notifies that the rasterizer has changed. Typically, the
	// rasterizer's CacheSignature() will be used to tell them apart.
	NotifyRasterizerChange(mask.Rasterizer) // called on config changes too

	// Notifies that the fractional drawing position has changed.
	// Only the 6 bits corresponding to the non-integer part of each
	// coordinate are considered.
	NotifyFractChange(fract.Point)

	//NotifyOtherChange(any) // more methods like this could be added

	// --- cache access methods ---

	// Gets the mask image for the given glyph index and current configuration.
	// The bool indicates whether the mask has been found (as it may be nil).
	GetMask(sfnt.GlyphIndex) (GlyphMask, bool)

	// Passes a mask image for the given glyph index and current
	// configuration to the underlying cache. PassMask should only
	// be called after GetMask() fails.
	//
	// Given a specific configuration, the contents of the mask image
	// must always be consistent. This implies that passed masks may be
	// ignored if a mask is already cached under that configuration, as
	// it will be considered superfluous. In other words: passing different
	// masks for the same configuration may cause inconsistent results.
	PassMask(sfnt.GlyphIndex, GlyphMask)

	// Notice that many more methods could be provided, like Get/Pass
	// for Advance, Kern, Bounds, etc., and other methods like Clear()
	// or ReleaseFont(), but since etxt doesn't need that, the interface
	// is limited to masks. You can expand whatever you want with your
	// own interfaces and type assertions.
	//
	// Hinting is also another interesting topic, but since sfnt doesn't
	// apply hinting instructions, there's not much to do here. Even if sfnt
	// did, managing glyph "variants" would be wiser, as hinting instructions
	// often exist only for a few characters at a few specific sizes only,
	// and you may not want to keep lots of superfluous duplicated masks for
	// hinted and unhinted configs.
